<h2>Travel By YES</h2>

<p class="quote">We believe the power of your true YES can take you anywhere - and we are taking that belief on the road, following our YESES wherever they take us next, and learning how to do it as a playful community of individuals, children, family, and artists ... inspiring others to find their true YESES along the way!</p>

<p class="quote">We are actively seeking-out people in whom we can help ignite the spark of a playful YES. Come on by, knock on our door, share and enjoy who you are inside your true YES, with us!</p>

<p><i>Inspired by yet another person stopping by after visiting our website and saying "I like you guys but I can't figure out what you are doing!".</i></p>
